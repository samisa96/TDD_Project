# Test-Driven Development Project

Test-driven development is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle:
requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved so that the tests pass.
___
In our project, we worked on TDD's attitude.
First, we coded the test cases for each software and then we coded the BMI software and the Bubble Sort software.
